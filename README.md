# STATS 500 Final Project

## Abstract

Shared micromobility has become more popular in the last few years, offering benefits such as reduced traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions. However, increased shared micromobility vehicles usage also presents challenges related to rising demand and profitability. Implementing a model to predict trip duration can help operators anticipate demand and optimize profitability. In this project, we implemented a multiple linear regression model using trip duration as the response variable and trip distance, month, hour, day of week, the district of trip origin and the vehicle type as the predictors. The regression analysis revealed that trip duration is influenced by all these factors, with varying magnitudes. For example, longer distance was associated with longer trips, while scooter trips were shorter than bicycle trips. Additionally, the results provided insights into the temporal, spatial and monthly effects on trip duration, which is information that can be used to improve the profitability of shared micromobility.
